## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete patient 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete patient 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePatientCommand` or `DeleteNoteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a patient or a note).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the CaseTrack data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/casetrack/app/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CaseTrack data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `casetrack.app.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add new patient feature

#### Implementation

The add patient feature adds a patient to the CaseTrack.

<puml src="diagrams/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `add n/Alice ... i/5000 mi/diabetes` Command" />

How add patient works:

1. `AddressBookParser` creates a `AddCommandParser` to parse the add command.
2. `AddCommandParser` identifies the command as a patient addition based on the "add" keyword.
3. `AddCommand` is created with the patient details.
4. The command validates the patient details and creates a new patient object.
5. The patient is added to the CaseTrack and the UI is updated.

### Search feature

#### Implementation

The search feature finds patients by name, phone number, email, or tags using specialized predicate classes.

<puml src="diagrams/SearchSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `search number +6591234567` Command" />

How the search works:

1. `AddressBookParser` creates a `FindCommandParser` to parse the search command.
2. `FindCommandParser` extracts the search type and keywords.
3. An appropriate predicate is created (e.g., `PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate` for phone searches).
4. `FindCommand` updates the filtered patient list using the predicate.
5. The predicate validates keywords and matches against patient's phone (including country codes).

### Add new note feature

#### Implementation

The add note feature adds a note to a patient.

<puml src="diagrams/NoteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `add note 1 2` Command" />

How add note works:

1. `AddressBookParser` creates a `NoteCommandParser` to parse the add command.
2. `NoteCommandParser` identifies the command as a note addition based on the "note" keyword.
3. `NoteCommand` is created with the patient index and note text.
4. The command retrieves the patient and validates that the note text is not empty.
5. The note is added to the patient's list of notes using `Person#addNote()`.
6. The patient is updated back to the model and the UI is updated.

### Delete patient / note feature

#### Implementation

The delete feature supports two types of delete operations: deleting patients and deleting notes from patients.

**Delete Patient Command**

The `DeletePatientCommand` removes a patient from the CaseTrack.

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete patient 1` Command" />

How delete patient works:

1. `AddressBookParser` creates a `DeleteCommandParser` to parse the delete command.
2. `DeleteCommandParser` identifies the command as a patient deletion based on the "patient" keyword.
3. `DeletePatientCommand` is created with the patient index.
4. The command retrieves the patient from the filtered list and calls `Model#deletePerson()`.
5. The patient is removed from the CaseTrack and the UI is updated.

**Delete Note Command**

The `DeleteNoteCommand` removes a specific note from a patient's record.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteNoteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete note 1 2` Command" />

How delete note works:

1. `AddressBookParser` creates a `DeleteCommandParser` to parse the delete command.
2. `DeleteCommandParser` identifies the command as a note deletion based on the "note" keyword.
3. `DeleteNoteCommand` is created with both patient and note index.
4. The command retrieves the patient and validates that the note index is valid.
5. The note is removed from the patient's list of notes using `Person#removeNote()`.
6. The patient is updated back to the model and the UI is updated.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

This appendix lists planned enhancements for upcoming releases.

1. Make product terminology consistent across UI, logs, and docs
   - Feature flaw: Mixed "AddressBook" terms remain in UI messages, class names, and diagrams, which can confuse users (e.g., error logs mention `AddressBookStorage`).
   - Change: Standardize user-facing terminology to "CaseTrack" and patient-centric terms. Update UI strings, log messages, and documentation references. No functional behavior changes.
   - Sample outputs:
     - Before: `Failed to save AddressBook to file.`
     - After: `Failed to save CaseTrack data to file.`

2. Make medical information input structured and readable
   - Feature flaw: The `m/` field is an unstructured free‑text blob, making information hard to read and impossible to filter precisely.
   - Change: Accept optional subfields when adding/editing a patient, and render them as labeled sections in the UI.
   - Sample inputs:
     ```
     add n/Noah Tan p/91234567 e/noah.tan@example.com a/123 Serangoon Ave i/4000 \
       v/BP 128/82; Pulse 76; Temp 37.1 \
       al/Penicillin(rash), Peanuts(swelling) \
       mh/T2D(2019); Hypertension(2021) \
       cm/Metformin 500mg daily; Lisinopril 10mg daily \
       cn/Reports occasional dizziness
     ```
   - Sample UI (textual):
     - Vitals: BP 128/82, Pulse 76, Temp 37.1°C
     - Allergies: Penicillin (rash), Peanuts (swelling)
     - History: T2D (2019), Hypertension (2021)
     - Medications: Metformin 500mg daily; Lisinopril 10mg daily
     - Notes: Reports occasional dizziness

3. Make Help command restore and focus the Help window
   - Feature flaw: Re-running `help` when the Help window is minimized does nothing visible; users think the command failed.
   - Change: If a Help window exists, bring it to front and un-minimize it; otherwise, open a new Help window. Provide a status message when restored.
   - Sample behavior:
     - Command: `help` (when Help is minimized) ➜ Help window is restored and focused; status bar shows: `Help window restored`.
     - Command: `help` (when Help is closed) ➜ Help window opens as usual.

4. Extend search to cover medical conditions in patient records
   - Feature flaw: Existing search supports name/phone/email/tag only; users cannot find patients by conditions or medications stored in medical info.
   - Change: Extend the existing `search` command with qualifiers that filter by structured medical info or substrings within the medical information field.
   - Sample inputs:
     ```
     search condition asthma
     search condition diabetes
     search meds metformin
     search allergy penicillin
     ```
   - Expected outcome: Lists patients whose medical information matches the qualifier (e.g., all patients with asthma or taking Metformin).

5. Add country code context for consistent phone number handling
    - Feature flaw: Phone numbers with and without country codes (e.g., "9111 1111" vs "+65 9111 1111") are treated as distinct, allowing duplicate patients with identical details but different phone number formats to be added.
    - Change: Allow users to configure a default country code in application settings. When checking for duplicates, normalize all phone numbers by applying the default country code to numbers lacking one. Display the active country code setting prominently in the UI and provide clear feedback about phone number normalization.
    - Sample inputs:
    ```
     setcountry +65
     add n/John Doe p/9111 1111 e/john@example.com a/123 Street
     add n/John Doe p/+65 9111 1111 e/john@example.com a/123 Street
    ```
    - Sample behavior:
        - Command: `setcountry +65` ➜ Status bar shows: `Default country code set to +65. Phone numbers without country codes will be treated as +65 numbers for duplicate detection.`
        - First `add` command succeeds; internally normalized and stored as "+65 9111 1111"
        - Second `add` command fails with: `This patient already exists in CaseTrack. A patient with the name "John Doe" and phone number "+65 9111 1111" is already registered.`
        - UI displays country code indicator in settings panel (e.g., "Default Country Code: +65") and shows normalized format in patient details

6. Make result display box dynamically resizable for improved readability
    - Feature flaw: The result display box remains fixed in size, requiring users to scroll vertically and/or horizontally to view long messages or error feedback, even when the application window is maximized. This breaks the natural command-feedback flow and hinders usability.
    - Change: Implement dynamic resizing for the result display box with automatic text wrapping and adaptive height. The box should expand to accommodate longer messages up to a reasonable maximum, and all UI components should resize proportionally when the application window is resized. Enable smooth vertical scrolling only when messages exceed the maximum displayable height.
    - Sample behavior:
        - User executes command with invalid format ➜ Result box expands vertically to display the complete error message without horizontal scrolling; text wraps naturally within the available width.
        - User maximizes application window ➜ Result box scales proportionally, displaying more content without requiring scrolling for moderately long messages.
        - User executes command with extremely long output ➜ Result box expands to predefined maximum height (e.g., 40% of window height), then enables smooth vertical scrolling for remaining content.
        - All feedback messages remain immediately visible without manual scrolling for typical use cases, preserving the CLI-style immediate feedback experience.
