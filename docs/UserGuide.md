# CaseTrack User Guide

CaseTrack is a **desktop app for managing patients, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CaseTrack can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for CaseTrack.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar casetrack.jar` command to run the application.<br>

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 i/1200` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the CaseTrack.

   * `delete patient 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all patients.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* **EMAIL**: Should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
  1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
  2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
  The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
    - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a patient: `add`

Adds a patient to the CaseTrack.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS i/INCOME [m/MEDICAL_INFO] [t/TAG]…​`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Constraints:**

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note on Duplicate Patients:**
CaseTrack prevents adding duplicate patients. A patient is considered a duplicate if **both** the name and phone number match an existing patient:
- Name matching is **case-insensitive** (e.g., "John Doe" = "john doe")
- Extra spaces in names are ignored (e.g., "John Doe" = "John  Doe")
- Multiple patients can share the same name if they have different phone numbers
- Multiple patients can share the same phone number if they have different names

Examples:
- ✅ Allowed: "John Doe" (91234567) and "John Doe" (98765432) - same name, different phone
- ✅ Allowed: "John Doe" (91234567) and "Jane Doe" (91234567) - different name, same phone
- ❌ Blocked: "John Doe" (91234567) and "john doe" (91234567) - duplicate (case-insensitive match)
- ❌ Blocked: "John Doe" (91234567) and "John  Doe" (91234567) - duplicate (whitespace ignored)

</box>

### Listing all patients : `list`

Shows a list of all patients in the CaseTrack.

Format: `list`

### Editing a patient : `edit patient`

Edits an existing patient in the CaseTrack.

Format: `edit patient <PATIENT_INDEX> [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [i/INCOME] [m/MEDICAL_INFO] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing names, they should only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, periods (.), apostrophes ('), hyphens (-), 's/o', 'd/o', 'S/O', or 'D/O', and cannot be fully numeric.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the patient will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the patient's tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit patient 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st patient to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit patient 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd patient to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
*  `edit patient 3 i/2500.50` Updates only the income of the 3rd patient.
*  `edit patient 4 m/Diabetes` Updates only the medical info of the 4th patient.

### Locating patients: `search`

Finds patients whose specified field contains any of the given keywords.

Format: `search FIELD KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
![case-insensitive search example](images/caseInsensitiveSearchExample.png)
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Patients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
![result for OR search with multiple keywords](images/searchOrMultipleKeywords.png)
* Supported fields: `name`, `number`, `email`, `tag`

**Matching behavior varies by field:**
* **Name search**: Partial matches are supported. e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`, `Hans Gruber`, `Johann`
![comparison images showing partial name matching](images/partialNameMatchingExample.png)
* **Number search**: Partial matches are supported. e.g. `9123` will match `91234567`
* **Email search**: Partial matches are supported. e.g. `alice` will match `alice@example.com`
* **Tag search**: Partial matches are supported. e.g. `friend` will match tags like `friendly` or `best-friend`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important Note on Multiple Search Values (number, email, tag):**
For `number`, `email`, and `tag` searches, multiple keywords are treated as separate search terms with OR logic. This can cause unexpected results:
* `search number 2 1` searches for numbers containing "2" OR "1" separately (won't find "21 98765432" as intended)
* `search number 21` searches for numbers containing "21" as a sequence (correctly finds "21 98765432")

To search for a specific sequence or value in these fields, provide it as a single keyword without spaces.

**Note:** Name search works differently - multiple keywords are useful for finding different people (e.g., `search name John David` finds anyone named John OR David).

</box>

Examples:
* `search name John` returns `john` and `John Doe` (full word match)
* `search name alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `search number +65` returns patients with phone number containing `+65` (e.g. `+6598765432`)
![example showing search by country code](images/searchNumberOnCountryCode.png)
* `search number 9123` returns patients with phone number containing `9123` (e.g. `91234567`)
![example showing search by phone number](images/searchByPhoneNumberExample.png)

* `search email alice` returns patients with email containing `alice` (e.g. `alice@example.com`)
![example showing search by email](images/searchByEmailExample.png)
* `search tag friend colleague` returns patients with tags containing `friend` or `colleague`
![example showing partial tag matching](images/partialTagMatchingExample.png)

**Note:** If no patients match your search criteria, an empty list will be displayed:

![empty search results example](images/emptySearchResultsExample.png)

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Copy the `data/casetrack.json` file to the new computer's CaseTrack folder. Both computers must meet the security requirements in [Data security and privacy](#data-security-and-privacy). Transfer the file securely (e.g., encrypted USB drive or internal network).

**Q**: Is my patient data encrypted?<br>
**A**: No, data is stored in plaintext. Use CaseTrack only on secure, offline systems. See [Data security and privacy](#data-security-and-privacy) for requirements.

**Q**: Can I use CaseTrack on my personal laptop?<br>
**A**: Only if it meets security requirements: no internet access, physical security, and access controls. Get approval from your data protection officer first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
